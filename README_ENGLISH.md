If you have an NVIDIA GPU with more than 6GB of video memory, you can configure an additional GPU environment to use GPU reasoning. To do this, a Linux installation (Ubuntu 18.04) is required.

CPU reasoning is less efficient and may not be smooth and responsive.
This project was tested on an RTX3080Ti.
